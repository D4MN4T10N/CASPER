#### Simple C&C:
Connects back to command server where we are listning for incoming connections. The data between server and casper is encoded with base64 encoding using a key to obfuscate it a little bit. 

#### Commands:
    * shell cmd                   <sends shell command>
    * download url                <download and execute via shell>
    * schtasks create/delete/run  <create/delete/run schtasks tasks>
    * clone                       <clones myself to temp directory>

    * removal                     <remove myself>
    * quit                        <quit server>
